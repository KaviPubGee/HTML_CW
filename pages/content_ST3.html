                    <h2>Coral Reef Ecosystems and Biodiversity</h2>
                    <img src="../assets/img/reef-biodiversity.jpg" alt="A vibrant coral reef teeming with colorful fish and marine life.">
                    <p>Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth, supporting over 25% of marine species despite covering less than 0.1% of the ocean floor. They are primarily built by calcium carbonate secretions from tiny animals called coral polyps, which form complex structures over centuries. Reefs host a variety of organisms, including fish, invertebrates (e.g., sea urchins, starfish), and algae, which engage in symbiotic relationships. For example, zooxanthellae algae live within coral polyps, providing energy through photosynthesis while corals offer protection. These vibrant ecosystems provide habitats, breeding grounds, and nurseries for thousands of species like clownfish, parrotfish, and sharks.</p>

                    <h2>Coastal Marine Habitats</h2>
                    <img src="../assets/img/mangrove-nursery.jpg" alt="A mangrove forest with its intricate root system visible in the clear shallow water, sheltering small fish.">
                    <p>Coastal marine habitats like mangroves, seagrass beds, and estuaries are critical transition zones between land and sea. Mangroves, with their tangled roots, thrive in saline coastal waters, stabilizing shorelines and providing safe nurseries for juvenile fish and crustaceans. Seagrass beds, found in shallow coastal waters, are underwater meadows that support species like seahorses and dugongs while sequestering vast amounts of carbon. Estuaries, where rivers meet the sea, are nutrient-rich zones that foster diverse life, including crabs, oysters, and migratory birds. These habitats are deeply interconnected with coral reefs, as many species move between them during different life stages.</p>

                    <h2>Role in Supporting Marine Food Webs</h2>
                    <img src="../assets/img/reef-food-web.jpg" alt="An underwater scene showing the food chain, with small fish eating algae on coral, being eaten by a larger fish, which is being watched by a reef shark.">
                    <p>Reefs and coastal habitats are the foundation of marine food webs. Coral reefs provide food and shelter for primary consumers like herbivorous fish (e.g., parrotfish that graze on algae) and invertebrates. These, in turn, are prey for secondary consumers like groupers or octopuses. Apex predators, such as sharks, rely on the abundance of prey in these areas to survive. Coastal habitats contribute by producing biomass (e.g., detritus from decaying seagrass) that feeds detritivores and small fish, which then support larger predators. These ecosystems also export nutrients to adjacent deep-sea and open-ocean environments, linking all marine food webs together.</p>

                    <h2>Human Dependence on Coastal Life</h2>
                    <img src="../assets/img/coastal-fishing-market.jpg" alt="A bustling local fish market in a coastal community, with fresh reef fish displayed for sale.">
                    <p>Coastal marine ecosystems are vital to human communities. They support fisheries that provide food and livelihoods for millions, especially in developing nations. Reef fish like snapper and grouper are staples in many diets, while shellfish from estuaries are economically significant. These habitats also drive tourism, with coral reefs attracting divers and snorkelers, generating billions in revenue annually. For example, the Great Barrier Reef contributes over $6 billion to Australia’s economy. Furthermore, these ecosystems hold immense cultural value, with indigenous communities relying on them for traditional practices and spiritual significance. Our economies and survival are directly tied to the health of our coasts and reefs.</p>
