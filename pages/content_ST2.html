          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <img src="/assets/img/trash-in-water.jpeg" alt="Ocean Pollution">
          <p>Ocean pollution is the contamination of our oceans by harmful substances—most commonly plastic, oil, and
            chemicals. Every year, millions of tons of waste end up in the sea, threatening marine life, disrupting
            ecosystems, and even affecting human health. What once were vibrant underwater habitats are now battling an
            invisible enemy. Understanding the causes and consequences of ocean pollution is the first step toward
            saving our blue planet.</p>

          <h2>Causes of Ocean Pollution</h2>
          <img src="/assets/img/water-pollution-runoff-river.jpeg" alt="Ocean Pollution">
          <p>The main causes of ocean pollution come from both land and sea:</p><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Plastic Waste: Around 8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year. Bottles, bags, and fishing
              gear don't break down—they just break apart, becoming deadly microplastics.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Industrial Waste & Sewage: Factories often dump untreated waste into rivers that flow into oceans,
              bringing toxic chemicals and heavy metals.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Oil Spills: Large oil leaks from tankers or drilling rigs poison water, suffocate marine animals, and coat
              coastlines in sludge.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Agricultural Runoff: Fertilizers and pesticides wash off farms during rain and enter waterways, creating
              “dead zones” where no life can survive.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="card" id="effects">
          <h2>Effects of Ocean Pollution</h2>
          <img src="/assets/img/Turtle-eating-plastic.png" alt="Ocean Pollution">
          <p>Ocean pollution has devastating consequences:</p><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Marine Animal Deaths: Turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Birds eat bottle caps thinking they
              are
              food. Whales wash up with stomachs full of trash.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Coral Reef Bleaching: Chemical changes in water stress coral, causing them to lose color and die—affecting
              thousands of species.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Microplastics in the Food Chain: Tiny plastic particles are eaten by fish… which are then eaten by us.
              Scientists have even found microplastics in human blood and lungs.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Climate Impact: Polluted oceans lose their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which worsens global warming.
            </li>
          </ul>
