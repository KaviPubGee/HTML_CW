                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p> User Profile page was built using semantic HTML elements such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to provide clear structure and improve readability. 
                      CSS was used for layout and styling, including flexbox for alignment and padding/margins for spacing.
                       We used consistent font styles and colors to maintain visual harmony across the site.
                       The use of IDs allowed for internal navigation and section targeting.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                      <p>
                        Accessibility was addressed by using descriptive <code>alt</code> text for all images, ensuring high contrast between text and background, and keeping the navigation keyboard-friendly. Headings are used in a logical order to support screen readers, and links include meaningful text.

                <h2 id="sitemap" class="section">SiteMap</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>
                      The Site Map page was created using structured HTML lists to represent the navigation paths of the website. An unordered list <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with nested list items <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> was used to show the site hierarchy clearly. Semantic tags like <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> helped define content roles. CSS was used to style the list with proper spacing and indentation for clarity. Links within the site map point to relevant pages using anchor tags <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for easy navigation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                      <p>
                        To improve accessibility, each link in the site map includes meaningful, descriptive text. The structure uses semantic elements and a clear heading hierarchy for screen reader compatibility. We ensured that users navigating with a keyboard can access all listed links, and contrast ratios were considered for readability.
                      </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Responsive Design IssuesGetting the website to look good on both desktop and mobile screens was difficult.
                     Elements were overlapping or misaligned, especially on smaller screens.</li>
                    <li>Navigation ProblemsSetting up smooth navigation using anchor links (#id) was tricky.
                     At first, some links didn't scroll correctly or landed in the wrong place.</li>

                    <li>File Naming and Structure Maintaining a clear and consistent folder structure (like separating pages, javascript, etc.) was challenging as the project grew.</li>

            <section>
                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                <p>This website has been created in compliance with Janet regulations and web development best practices. We ensured the use of valid HTML5 and CSS3 code, semantic structure (e.g., using &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;), and followed accessibility guidelines such as adding alternative text to images and ensuring good color contrast.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                The site layout is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, meeting the requirement for cross-device compatibility. We also used proper referencing for all borrowed images and content, and followed a consistent style across all pages. This shows our understanding and application of the required standards in web design and development.
